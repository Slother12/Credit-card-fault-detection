# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains transaction details, and the goal is to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Machine Learning Model Training (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks)
- Model Evaluation & Performance Metrics
- Deployment using Streamlit (Optional)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
   cd credit-card-fraud-detection
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
  

## Dataset
- The dataset used is typically the **Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection** dataset.
- It consists of anonymized transaction features and a fraud label (0: genuine, 1: fraudulent).

## Common Issues & Fixes
- **Imbalanced Dataset**: Use techniques like SMOTE or class weighting.
- **Overfitting**: Apply regularization, dropout (for deep learning), or pruning.
- **Poor Model Performance**: Tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
- **Missing Libraries**: Ensure all dependencies are installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
